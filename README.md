🧠 Disease Detection Portal using Machine Learning
This project is a multi-disease prediction portal enhanced with machine learning models that detect several critical diseases based on medical data inputs. In addition to individual disease prediction, the system now features a symptoms-based recommendation model that suggests which diseases the user should screen for, based on their reported symptoms.

🔍 Supported Diseases and Model Accuracies

The disease detection portal includes models for diabetes, heart disease, breast cancer, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and obesity. For example, the diabetes model (Logistic Regression) achieves 95% accuracy, and the Parkinson’s model (SVM) reaches 94%. A symptoms-based model recommends which diseases to screen for. Overall, each model achieves an accuracy greater than 0.92.
📌 These results demonstrate competitive performance when compared to recent published works like this study. Deep learning integration is being considered for future model improvements.
